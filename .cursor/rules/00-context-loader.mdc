# MEMORY BANK LOADER

## 1. CORE MEMORY
(The AI must always have these loaded to understand the project "Vibe" and "Laws")

### Priority 1: Specification Hierarchy (CHECK IN THIS ORDER)
- `docs/memory-bank/spec_deviation.md` - **Approved improvements** (overrides paper)
- `docs/memory-bank/paper_spec.md` - Reference design (fallback if no deviation)

### Priority 2: Project Context
- `docs/memory-bank/productContext.md`
- `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

## 2. NAVIGATION STRATEGY
- **Reference:** `docs/context/codebase_map.xml` contains the file tree and signatures.
- **Action:** Before creating a plan, search the XML map to locate relevant files. 
- **Constraint:** Do not assume file existence; check the map.
