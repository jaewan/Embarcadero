# Total Order Sequencer - Final Implementation

This directory contains the complete, production-ready implementation of the epoch-based Total Order Sequencer.

## Files

### Core Implementation
- **`algorithm.md`** - Original algorithm specification and design document
- **`sequencer.cpp`** - Final optimized implementation with epoch-based architecture
- **`Makefile`** - Build system for compiling the sequencer

### Baseline Validation & Results
- **`baseline_comparison.cpp`** - Comparative implementation: traditional vs epoch-based sequencing
- **`baseline_comparison_results.csv`** - Performance data validating architectural claims
- **`plot_baseline_comparison.py`** - Generates publication-quality comparison graphs

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the sequencer
make

# Run performance test
./sequencer

# Build and run baseline comparison (validates traditional vs epoch-based claims)
make baseline_comparison
./baseline_comparison

# Generate publication-quality comparison graph
python3 plot_baseline_comparison.py
```

## Key Results

### Epoch-Based Sequencer Performance
- **Perfect Ordering:** 100% correctness across all configurations (1-32 queues)
- **Linear Scaling:** Continuous throughput growth from 66K to 634K msgs/sec
- **Three Performance Tiers:** Based on per-queue efficiency degradation
- **Production Ready:** Well-defined capacity limits and deployment guidelines

### Baseline Validation (Traditional vs Epoch-Based)
- **Traditional Ceiling:** ~15K msgs/sec maximum, regardless of broker count
- **Epoch-Based Scaling:** Up to 318K msgs/sec with linear growth
- **Peak Improvement:** 22.4× better performance at 32 brokers
- **Average Improvement:** 12.7× across all scales
- **Correctness:** Traditional approach fails (4.5% completion), epoch-based maintains 100%

| 2    | 9-16        | ~32K msgs/sec       | 291K-526K msgs/sec   |
| 3    | 17-32       | ~20K msgs/sec       | 337K-634K msgs/sec   |

**Total Messages Tested:** 19.8 million  
**Ordering Violations:** Zero  
**Success Rate:** 100%
