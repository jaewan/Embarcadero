# Embarcadero Test Suite

## Current Status

- ✅ **E2E Tests:** Implemented in `e2e/` - Run actual broker clusters
- 🟡 **Unit Tests:** Archived in `archive/` - Disabled, need update for current architecture
- ❌ **Integration Tests:** Not yet implemented
- ❌ **Property Tests:** Not yet implemented (Paper Spec guarantees)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Run E2E tests
cd ../test/e2e
./run_all.sh

# Or run individual test
./test_basic_publish.sh
```

## Test Organization

## Why Unit Tests Are Archived

The unit tests were written for an older architecture (v0 with TInode) and are currently broken:
- Interfaces changed (BufferManager, SegmentManager APIs)
- Data structures changed (TInode → Bmeta/Blog migration in progress)
- Mocks don't match current implementation

They're **archived, not deleted** because:
- Show good testing patterns (gtest, gmock, concurrency tests)
- Can be updated when architecture stabilizes
- Reference for future unit test development

## Test Coverage

### What's Tested (E2E)
- ✅ Broker cluster startup (4 brokers)
- ✅ Client connection and publish
- ✅ Basic throughput measurement
- ✅ Crash detection

### What's NOT Tested (High Priority Gaps)
- ❌ FIFO ordering enforcement (Property 3d)
- ❌ f+1 durability (Property 4a)
- ❌ Broker failure recovery
- ❌ Sequencer failover
- ❌ Cache coherence primitives
- ❌ CXL memory allocation correctness
- ❌ Network partition handling

## Adding New Tests

### E2E Test (Recommended)
1. Copy `e2e/test_basic_publish.sh` as template
2. Modify test scenario
3. Add to `e2e/run_all.sh`
4. Add to `CMakeLists.txt`

### Unit Test (When Architecture Stabilizes)
1. Create `<component>_test.cc` using gtest
2. Add to `CMakeLists.txt`
3. Run: `cd build && make && ctest`

## Future Test Roadmap

### Phase 1: E2E Coverage (Current)
- [x] Basic publish flow
- [ ] Ordering guarantees
- [ ] Durability guarantees
- [ ] Failure scenarios

### Phase 2: Unit Test Revival
- [ ] Update BufferManager tests
- [ ] Add CXLManager tests
- [ ] Add HeartBeatManager tests
- [ ] Add Topic tests

### Phase 3: Property-Based Tests
- [ ] Verify Property 3d (Strong Total Ordering)
- [ ] Verify Property 4a (Full Durability)
- [ ] Verify cache coherence laws

### Phase 4: CI Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Automated test runs on PR
- [ ] Code coverage reporting

## Test Configuration

For faster tests, use smaller CXL sizes in `config/embarcadero.yaml`:

```yaml
cxl:
  size: 4294967296             # 4GB (fast) vs 68719476736 (64GB, slow)
  emulation_size: 4294967296
```

4GB CXL maps in ~4 seconds vs 66 seconds for 64GB.
