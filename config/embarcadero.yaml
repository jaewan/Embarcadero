  # Broker settings
  broker:
    port: 1214                    # Main broker port
    broker_port: 12140           # Alternative broker port
    heartbeat_interval: 3        # Heartbeat interval in seconds
    max_brokers: 4               # Maximum number of brokers in cluster
    cgroup_core: 85              # CPU core for cgroup assignment

  # CXL memory configuration
  cxl:
    size: 68719476736            # CXL memory size (64GB)
    emulation_size: 34359738368  # CXL emulation memory size (32GB)
    device_path: "/dev/dax0.0"   # CXL device path
    numa_node: 2                 # NUMA node for CXL memory

  # Storage configuration
  storage:
    segment_size: 4294967296      # Segment size (4GB) to ensure >=1 segment per broker
    batch_headers_size: 65536    # Batch headers region size (64KB)
    batch_size: 2097152          # PERF TUNED: 2MB batch size - balances memory usage with network efficiency (~512 messages/batch)
                              # Works optimally with 256MB buffers (128 batches per buffer before wrapping)
    num_disks: 2                 # Number of disks for storage
    max_topics: 32               # Maximum number of topics
    topic_name_size: 31          # Maximum topic name length
    use_new_bmeta: true          # Enable dual-write to BrokerMetadata (Bmeta)
                              # Set to false to disable dual-write pattern during migration testing

  # Network configuration
  network:
    io_threads: 12               # UPDATED: Right-sized to match client connections (4 pub + 3 sub per broker + overhead)
    disk_io_threads: 4           # Number of disk IO threads
    sub_connections: 3           # Set to 3 connections per broker as requested
    zero_copy_send_limit: 65536     # PERF TUNED: 64KB threshold - optimal for MSG_ZEROCOPY (Linux kernel sweet spot, works with 2MB batches)

  # Corfu sequencer configuration
  corfu:
    sequencer_port: 50052        # Corfu sequencer port
    replication_port: 50053      # Corfu replication port

  # Scalog sequencer configuration
  scalog:
    sequencer_port: 50051        # Scalog sequencer port
    replication_port: 50052      # Scalog replication port
    sequencer_ip: "192.168.60.173"  # Scalog sequencer IP address
    local_cut_interval: 100      # Scalog local cut interval

  # Platform detection
  platform:
    is_intel: false              # Intel platform flag
    is_amd: false                # AMD platform flag
