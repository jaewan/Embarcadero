# Embarcadero Configuration File
# This file contains all configurable parameters for the Embarcadero distributed message broker

embarcadero:
  # Cluster: all brokers are ingestion brokers (broker 0 runs sequencer + data path)
  cluster:
    is_sequencer_node: false     # Head (broker 0) also ingests; B0 gets PBR ring and CV advances
    sequencer_broker_id: 0
    data_broker_ids: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # All 4 brokers accept publishes

  # Version information
  version:
    major: 1
    minor: 0

  # Broker settings
  broker:
    port: 1214                    # Main broker port
    broker_port: 12140           # Alternative broker port
    heartbeat_interval: 3        # Heartbeat interval in seconds
    max_brokers: 5               # 1 head + 4 ingestion brokers
    cgroup_core: 85              # CPU core for cgroup assignment

  # CXL memory configuration
  cxl:
    size: 68719476736            # CXL memory size (64GB)
    emulation_size: 34359738368  # CXL emulation memory size (32GB)
    device_path: "/dev/dax0.0"   # CXL device path
    numa_node: 2                 # NUMA node for CXL memory

  # Storage configuration
  storage:
    segment_size: 4294967296      # Segment size (4GB) to ensure >=1 segment per broker
    # PBR (batch header ring) size per topic per broker. Must hold all in-flight batches for 10GB/4 brokers.
    # 10MB = 81,920 slots (128B BatchHeader each); 10GB/4 = 2.5GB/broker → ~1.2k batches at 2MB batch → plenty of headroom.
    # Order 0 does not write to PBR (ORDER_0_SKIP_PBR); higher orders need this ring for sequencer consumption.
    batch_headers_size: 10485760  # 10MB
    batch_size: 2097152          # PERF TUNED: 2MB batch size - balances memory usage with network efficiency (~512 messages/batch)
                              # Works optimally with 256MB buffers (128 batches per buffer before wrapping)
    num_disks: 2                 # Number of disks for storage
    max_topics: 32               # Maximum number of topics
    topic_name_size: 31          # Maximum topic name length
    use_new_bmeta: true          # Enable dual-write to BrokerMetadata (Bmeta)
                              # Set to false to disable dual-write pattern during migration testing

  # Network configuration
  network:
    io_threads: 6               # ReqReceive threads: must be >= threads_per_broker + sub_connections (3+3=6) so every inbound connection gets a thread; was 4 → 9/12 subscriber timeouts
    disk_io_threads: 2           # REDUCED: Testing if fewer disk threads help. Was 4, now 2.
    sub_connections: 3           # Set to 3 connections per broker as requested
    zero_copy_send_limit: 65536     # PERF TUNED: 64KB threshold - optimal for MSG_ZEROCOPY (Linux kernel sweet spot, works with 2MB batches)

    # Publish path: blocking recv() directly to BLog (CXL). No staging; single code path.
    # PBR backpressure: stop reading TCP when ring above high %, resume when below low %.
    # pbr_high_watermark_pct: 80
    # pbr_low_watermark_pct: 50
    # Pipeline profile (DrainPayloadToBuffer, etc.). Set false for peak bandwidth benchmarks (removes timing overhead).
    enable_publish_pipeline_profile: false

  # Corfu sequencer configuration

    sequencer_port: 50052        # Corfu sequencer port
    replication_port: 50053      # Corfu replication port

  # Scalog sequencer configuration

    sequencer_ip: "192.168.60.173"  # Scalog sequencer IP address
