  EMBARCADERO SEQUENCER - ABLATION STUDY
=================================================================

Config: 4 brokers, 8 producers, 5s, 10% L5, 2 runs, std::sort, validate=yes, pbr_entries=4194304

=================================================================
  ABLATION 1: Per-Batch vs Per-Epoch (paired, 2 runs)
=================================================================
  (Per-epoch: atomics = epochs with non-empty output; when sequencer is bottleneck,
   epochs << duration/τ, so atomics << 10000 for 5s @ 500μs.)

  WARNING: PBR_full=259784 (5.2% of attempts). Run may be saturation-bound; consider larger pbr_entries or fewer producers for interpretable throughput.
  [INVALID RUN] PBR saturation > 1%; results do not reflect sequencer algorithm performance.
