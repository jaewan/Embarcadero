  EMBARCADERO SEQUENCER - ABLATION STUDY
=================================================================

Config: 4 brokers, 8 producers, 10s, 10% L5, 5 runs, std::sort, validate=yes

=================================================================
  ABLATION 1: Per-Batch vs Per-Epoch (paired, 5 runs)
=================================================================
  (Per-epoch: atomics = epochs with non-empty output; when sequencer is bottleneck,
   epochs << duration/τ, so atomics << 10000 for 5s @ 500μs.)
