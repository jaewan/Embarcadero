  EMBARCADERO SEQUENCER - ABLATION STUDY
=================================================================

Config: 4 brokers, 8 producers, 10s, 10% L5, 5 runs, std::sort, validate=yes, pbr_entries=1048576

=================================================================
  ABLATION 1: Per-Batch vs Per-Epoch (paired, 5 runs)
=================================================================
  (Per-epoch: atomics = epochs with non-empty output; when sequencer is bottleneck,
   epochs << duration/τ, so atomics << 10000 for 5s @ 500μs.)

  WARNING: PBR_full=515849 (2.6% of attempts). Run may be saturation-bound; consider larger pbr_entries or fewer producers for interpretable throughput.
  [INVALID RUN] PBR saturation > 1%; results do not reflect sequencer algorithm performance.
  [COMPLETENESS WARN] large in-flight at t1: 2957244 (injected=22131585, accounted=19174341)
  [SANITY FAIL] P99 latency 4357.1 ms is unreasonable; system is backlogged.
  [SANITY FAIL] Throughput 1916823.1 << expected min ~4000000 batches/s.
  [SANITY FAIL] PBR full 2.6% indicates saturation.
